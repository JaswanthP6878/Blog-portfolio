### hello this is my first blog post
I am creating this blog so that i can write about stuff i learn and also about some new ideas which i work on. I am very curious and keep learning new stuff each day and want to use a watered down version of the **feyman** technique to better understand those concepts. I meant watered down in the sense that probably no one would see this blog but i can put effort of explaining and writing about concepts i find will help me learn better.

I mostly work on web development and devops(my day job) but i love distributed systems(currently reading the "boar" book and trying to write a map-reduce framework) so most of the blog will be filled by related material. Apart from this I will write an occasional non-techincal post like a book review or some op-ed article.

BTW i have written this blog from scratch using the **Astro** framework. you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/JaswanthP6878/Blog-portfolio)
